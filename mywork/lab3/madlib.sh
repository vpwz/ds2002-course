echo Once upon a time, in a $VAR1 land far away, there was a $VAR2 who dreamed of becoming a $VAR3. 
echo One day, they stumbled upon a $VAR4 $VAR5 in the middle of the $VAR6 that led to a magical $VAR7. 
echo In this $VAR8, they met a wise old $VAR9 who offered them a $VAR10 that would grant them one wish. THE END.
